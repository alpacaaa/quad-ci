# Quad CI

![Build Status][]

Quad CI is a _simple_, _tiny_ and _beginner friendly_ Continuous Integration system written in Haskell.

### Features

- sandboxed builds in docker containers
- multi-node architecture with agents picking up jobs to work on
- http api to interact with the frontend and other nodes
- support for triggering builds with github webhooks

All in 1K lines of code!

### Getting Started

```bash
# Run server
$ stack run -- start-server

# Run agent
$ stack run -- start-agent
```

Try running a simple build:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
@test/github-payload.sample.json "http://localhost:9000/webhook/github"

```

Quad CI comes with a web UI, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`. To install it, run the following:

```bash
cd frontend/
yarn
yarn next
```

### Why?

This project tries to answer the question: _How do I build an application with Haskell?_

Intermediate level _practical_ resources on Haskell are notoriously hard to find. My goal is to provide a real world example of an Haskell application, while keeping the scope small (Quad CI is only 1000 lines of code, including tests).

Another goal is to showcase [Simple Haskell](https://www.simplehaskell.org/) (or at least my own interpretation of it).

Finally, I think `RecordDotSytax` is one of the coolest things that happened in Haskell land recently and I wanted to show how to use it in practice.

### Architecture

Single server - multiple agents.

Builds share workspace.

STM queue

1 build/agent concurrency limit


### Codebase overview

_`src/Core.hs`_  
Domain types (`Build`, `Pipeline` etc.) along with main state machine (`progress`)

_`src/Docker.hs`_  
Talks to Docker api

_`src/Runner.hs`_  
Runs a single build, collecting logs (`Core.collectLogs`) and processing state updates (`Core.progress`)

_`src/JobHandler.hs`_  
Introduces `Job` type, which is just a `Build` that can be _queued_ and _scheduled_

_`src/JobHandler/Memory.hs`_  
An in-memory implementation of `JobHandler`, built on top of STM

_`src/Github.hs`_  
Talks to Github api

_`src/Agent.hs`_  
Agents ask the server for work to do, run builds (`Runner`) and send updates back to the server

_`src/Server.hs`_  
The server collects jobs to be run (when receiving webhook events). It keeps an internal job queue (`JobHandler`) exposed as an http api (used by web ui)

_`src/Cli.hs`_  
Main entrypoint. Calls either `Server.run` or `Agent.run`

_`src/Socket.hs`_  
Low-level code to send http requests to a socket. Not interesting, can be ignored.
